******STATE OF FILES ********
Files in a Git repository can have 3 basic statuses, which include
1) Untracked
2) Staged
3) Committed

UNTRACKED FILES ---- These are files that have been created, but the system has not yet been informed to track these files. So technically changes made here are not tracked. 
Use git add command <filename> to add an untracked file to the staged state.

STAGED FILES ---- These are files that have been staged, ready to be committed. Any change made here is tracked by the system. 
Use git commmit command to commit all staged files.

Committed files ---- These are files that have been saved and tracked to the repository. It represent snapshot of the files in the working tree.


To find out about the status of a particular file, the git status command is used.

If you dont want git to not track specific files, you can ignore them using the .gitignore file, anything listed here is ignored by git. This is a good way to ignore files that contains or stores sensitive informations like passwords and others that should not be visible to the public.
