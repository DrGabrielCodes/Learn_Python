#The + (plus) operator is used to add two objects together
p = 4 + 6 #this gives 10
man = "a" + "b" # this gives "ab"

#Minus operator (-) : this subtracts one number from another. If the first is absent, it is assumed to be zero.
k = 56 - 22 #this gives 34
g =  - 99 #this gives -8 
print(p, man)

#Multiplication operator (*) : multiplies numbers or doubls strings by the multiplication factor
num = 55 
multiplied = num * 8
print (multiplied)
