Usually when you want to make a change to project, you can use the diff -u command and work with a file containing the change to be made

for instance say you want to make a change of an old_file to a new_file, use the command
diff -u old_file.py new_file.py > change.diff

The greater than sign here redirects the output of the diff command to a file.
Here, the contents of change.diff is generated with the contents of diff -u of the new_file and old_file

By adding -u, we include more context to the change.diff file, allowing the user to understand whats going on with the change. This generated file is commonly called the diff file or the patch file. it has all the chnges between the old and the new file.



The patch command
This command is used to make changes generated by diff file
pass the name of the file you want to change, with the diff file
patch old_file.py < change.diff
