You can view the contents of a file by using the command cat
for instance 
cat file1.py 

This gives the following info in file1.py:

def add(x, y):
   print(x+y)

add(20,30)

def subtract(x, y):
   print(x-y)

num3 = "75"
num4 = 77.3

#The diff command line can be used to spot the difference between two files

To find the difference between file1 and file2.py, simply use the diff command 
This gives 2 sections: the first section that reps any changes (c) to a particular line,
Then any new line additions (a)
diff file1.py file2.py 
into the command line 

This gives an output like this
$ diff file1.py file2.py
9,10c9,12
< num3 = "75"
< num4 = 77.3
\ No newline at end of file
---
> num3 = "4674"
> num4 = 4993.4
>
> #This is an addition
\ No newline at end of file


Here, the line 9,10c9,10 tells that lines 9 to 10 of file1 was changed or replaced by lines 9 and 12 of file2

less than symbol tells that those lines in file1 are not part of file2 while
greater than symbol tells that those lines in file2 are extra parts of file2 which are not in file1

A good way to actually highlight the additions is to use the prefic -u along with the diff command

diff -u file1.py file2.py

Here the lines with + are the added items to file2 which are not in file1
While the lines with -  are the lines in file1 which are not part of file2
