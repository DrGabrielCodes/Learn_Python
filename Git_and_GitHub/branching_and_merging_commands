What is a branch?
a branch is an independent line of a repository which points to the latest commit in that chain of development history.

By default when a repo is initialized, git creates the master branch. This is usually the known good state of the project, more like the perfect state of the project. This is not where you tryout something new.

If you have to try something new or add a new feature, you need to create a seperate branch. 

git branch 
This lists all the branches in the repository

git branch branch_name
This creates a new branch with the name branch_name

To switch to the a new branch or any branch use the checkout command
git checkout branch_name
This switches to another branch

To create another branch and automatically switch to it, use the shortcut command
git checkout -b new_branch

git branch -d new_branch
deletes the branch new_branch


Merging brnaches
This is the process of taking an independent snapshot of a branch and merging them into another
