#The + (plus) operator is used to add two objects together
d = 4 + 6 #this gives 10
man = "a" + "b" # this gives "ab"

#Minus operator (-) : this subtracts one number from another. If the first is absent, it is assumed to be zero.
k = 56 - 22 #this gives 34
g =  - 8 #this gives -8 
print(d, man)

#Multiplication operator (*) : multiplies numbers or doubls strings by the multiplication factor
num = 55 
multiplied = num * 8
print (multiplied)

#An example of its application to strings
string = "meao"
multi_string = string * 3
print(multi_string)


#Division operator (/): This gives the divided value (quotient) of a number by another number. Answer is always presented as a float
divided_num = multiplied / 4

#Floor operator (//): This gives the rounded number of a given quotient after division to the nearest lower integer
num1 = 9
num2 = 29
num3 = num2//num1 #this gives an answer of 3
num4 = num2/num1 #this gives an answer of 3.22
print(num3, "\n", num4)



#The modulus or remainder operator (%): This gives the remainder of any number divided by another number
num5 = num2 % num1
print(num5) # This will give 2
